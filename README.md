## Introduction

According to DSTI Scientific Advisory Board policy for ever-evolving programmes, this syllabus may be
subject to adaptations and changes when the class will be delivered by the selected Professor(s).
Applied MSc in Data Science & AI
MLOps with Adaltas
Combining development and operations (DevOps) is an approach to shorten the
development life cycle and improve software quality while delivering features,
fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives. We will
learn its most important building blocks, before extending it to the usage in data
science (MLOps). A machine learning model is only valuable once it can be used
togenerate business value. We will go through the steps of the ML lifecycle
from developmentto production. We will learn how versioning and testing help
us achieve reproducible data science, and how to leverage automation to speed up
the delivery of the pipelines.
